    "text": "a bear with a sore head",
    "desc": "The phrase 'a bear with a sore head' is an idiomatic expression used to describe someone who is in a very bad mood and behaves in an irritable or grumpy way.\nThe phrase is based on the assumption that a bear with a sore head would be very unpleasant to be around. Bears are typically large, powerful animals that can be dangerous if they feel threatened or agitated, and a sore head would likely exacerbate their already irritable nature. \nSimilarly, when someone is described as 'a bear with a sore head,' it means that they are in a state of extreme irritability or bad mood that may make them difficult to deal with. The phrase is often used humorously to describe someone who is being particularly grumpy or difficult, and it can be used in a wide range of contexts, from everyday situations to professional environments."

    "desc": "The term 'dark horse' refers to a person or thing that is relatively unknown or obscure, but suddenly emerges as a strong contender for success or victory in a competition or endeavor. In other words, it's an underdog that unexpectedly rises to the top. The origin of the term is believed to come from horse racing, where a dark horse was a horse that was not favored to win but ended up winning the race. This unexpected victory could result in high payouts for those who had bet on the dark horse. In a broader sense, the term can refer to any person or thing that is underestimated or overlooked but ultimately proves to be successful. For example, a relatively unknown candidate in a political election who ends up winning the race could be considered a dark horse. Overall, the term 'dark horse' implies an element of surprise, unpredictability, and potential for success against the odds."

    "desc": "'A dog's life' is an idiomatic expression that refers to a very difficult, unhappy, or unpleasant life. It is often used to describe a life that is filled with hardships, challenges, or a lack of opportunities. This expression is believed to have originated from the idea that dogs have difficult lives because they are often mistreated or neglected.

    "text": "a fish out of water",
    "desc": " is an idiomatic expression that describes a person who feels uncomfortable or out of place in their current surroundings or situation. The phrase comes from the idea that fish are creatures that live and breathe underwater, and so when they are taken out of that environment, they are in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable situation.

This can happen when someone is in a new place, among people with different beliefs or values, or in a situation that they are not accustomed to. However, with time and effort, it is possible to adapt to new surroundings and become more comfortable in unfamiliar situations."

    "text": "a long shot",
    "desc": "is an idiomatic expression that refers to an attempt or a goal that is unlikely to succeed. It is often used when someone is trying to achieve something that is difficult or seemingly impossible. For example, if someone is trying to win a race against much faster competitors, you could say that it's a long shot. The phrase comes from the world of horse racing, where a long shot is a horse that is not expected to win but has high odds. Despite the low probability of success, people often take long shots because the potential reward is so great. It can be a risky strategy, but it can also pay off if one is willing to take a chance and work hard to achieve their goals. In any case, it's important to keep a positive attitude and never give up on a long shot until the very end."

For example, if someone forgets a friend's birthday or important appointment, you could say that they have a memory like a sieve. It can be frustrating for both the person with the unreliable memory and those around them, but there are strategies and tools that can help improve memory, such as repetition, visualization, and association. With practice and effort, anyone can improve their memory and better retain important information."
