    "desc": "The phrase 'a bear with a sore head' is an idiomatic expression used to describe someone who is in a very bad mood and behaves in an irritable or grumpy way.\nThe phrase is based on the assumption that a bear with a sore head would be very unpleasant to be around. Bears are typically large, powerful animals that can be dangerous if they feel threatened or agitated, and a sore head would likely exacerbate their already irritable nature. \nSimilarly, when someone is described as 'a bear with a sore head,' it means that they are in a state of extreme irritability or bad mood that may make them difficult to deal with. The phrase is often used humorously to describe someone who is being particularly grumpy or difficult, and it can be used in a wide range of contexts, from everyday situations to professional environments."

    "desc": "The term 'dark horse' refers to a person or thing that is relatively unknown or obscure, but suddenly emerges as a strong contender for success or victory in a competition or endeavor. In other words, it's an underdog that unexpectedly rises to the top. The origin of the term is believed to come from horse racing, where a dark horse was a horse that was not favored to win but ended up winning the race. This unexpected victory could result in high payouts for those who had bet on the dark horse. In a broader sense, the term can refer to any person or thing that is underestimated or overlooked but ultimately proves to be successful. For example, a relatively unknown candidate in a political election who ends up winning the race could be considered a dark horse. Overall, the term 'dark horse' implies an element of surprise, unpredictability, and potential for success against the odds."
