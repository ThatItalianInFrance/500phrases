    "desc": "The phrase 'a bear with a sore head' is an idiomatic expression used to describe someone who is in a very bad mood and behaves in an irritable or grumpy way.\nThe phrase is based on the assumption that a bear with a sore head would be very unpleasant to be around. Bears are typically large, powerful animals that can be dangerous if they feel threatened or agitated, and a sore head would likely exacerbate their already irritable nature. \nSimilarly, when someone is described as 'a bear with a sore head,' it means that they are in a state of extreme irritability or bad mood that may make them difficult to deal with. The phrase is often used humorously to describe someone who is being particularly grumpy or difficult, and it can be used in a wide range of contexts, from everyday situations to professional environments."
